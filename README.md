## My Projects

### Weather App
    An assignment for the Odin Project, this weather app was created to practice APIs and async 
    functions.
    This app uses OpenWeatherMap's free weather API and is coded and styled from scratch using React.js.

### Shopping Cart
    This application was made to practice creating and styling a shop front using React.js.
