                <p className='about-para'>     
                    Located in Oak Ridge TN, I have been passionately learning web development following 
                    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" className='odin-link'>The Odin Project</a>, a full-stack curriculum teaching HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js 
                    . I have completed the course and am a capable Full-Stack developer. Through this course, I have learned
                    plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, have spent quality time practicing with 
                    <a href="https://reactjs.org/" className='odin-link'>React</a>
                    , the 
                    front-end framework. Additionally, I have worked with Node.js and Express, the backend technologies.

                    <h3> Front-End </h3>
                    <p>A desire to develop a consistent clean product pushes responsive design. With an understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and <a href="https://reactjs.org/" className='odin-link'>React</a>., I am driven to 
                            create beautiful and functional websites, designed for a clean and streamlined experience for all users.</p>

                    <h3> Back-End </h3>
                    <p>The Front-End of your application is only half the battle. If any authentication or data is needed, you will need a back-end. With a familiarity of 
                        <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" className='odin-link'>Node.js</a> and <a href="https://expressjs.com/" className='odin-link'>Express</a>, 
                        I am capable of creating any full-stack application to fit your needs.

                    <h3> Frameworks </h3>
                    <p>While most projects don't necessarily need a Front-End framework, the ability to implement one can drasitcally improve your workflow. 
                        I have utilized  <a href="https://reactjs.org/" className='odin-link'>React</a>. In addition, I have worked with <a href="https://expressjs.com/" className='odin-link'>Express</a> in order
                        to create efficient back-ends and REST APIs.
